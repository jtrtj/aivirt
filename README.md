__Aivirt is deployed [here](https://jtrtj.github.io/aivirt)__

This app gets 10 new questions every day from the [Aivirt API](https://github.com/jtrtj/aivirt_api). The API gets its questions from the [Open Trivia database](https://opentdb.com/) and a beautiful splash image related to each question's topic from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers).

This app is a work is progress as I have lots of features I would like to add. My goal is to make a quick succint trivia game that requires minimum commitment and yields maximum entertainment for trivia buffs. That is the reason there aren't any choices for subject matter or difficulty. It will always be ten random questions of varying difficulties.

#### Next Steps
1. Build functionality for a Random game so that a user can keep playing if Today's 10 questions weren't enough
1. Set up some kind of system to let a user know they have all ready played Today's game
1. Record game results in back end so that users can can see how they stacked up against other players
