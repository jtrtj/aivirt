__Aivirt is deployed [here](https://jtrtj.github.io/aivirt)__

This app gets 10 new questions every day from the [Aivirt API](https://github.com/jtrtj/aivirt_api). The API gets its questions from the [Open Trivia database](https://opentdb.com/) and a beautiful splash image related to each question's topic from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers).
